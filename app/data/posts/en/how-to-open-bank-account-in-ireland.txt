When you move to Ireland for the first time, it can be tough to open a bank account there (although you will need one since you are going to live there).

<span class="underline">Below are the steps to follow for opening a bank account easily in the Republic of Ireland (ROI)</span>
<ul class="italic">
    <li>First, find a job in Ireland and be hired.</li>
    <li>Go to PPS centre (Dublin or Cork) with your job contract, proof that you live somewhere in Ireland (can be wrote by the apart owner or by school if you are a temporary English student).</li>
    <li>Go to revenue centre with your PPS card (once you receive it) and ask for the Tax Credit Certificate.</li>
    <li>Then, with the tax credit certificate, banks will authorise you to open an account (the tax credit certificate is the easiest validate document to prove your address, except you have already electricity/gas bills under your name).</li>
    <li>Go to the nearest bank with your EU national ID/Passport, your Tax Credit Certificate and your employer contract (the employer contract is optional, but can help!).</li>
    <li>Then, give you bank account details to your company to get your first salary.</li>
</ul>
This whole process generally take 2/3 weeks in total. Just enough to give the IBAN to your employer before your first pay üí∞


P.S. For choosing the bank, I suggest you Permanent TSB. It's the bank that has the fewest agencies (but who go to agencies these days since everything can be fine online?). They are the cheapest, apparently easier to open an account there thank in the other banks and they saving rate is one of the best in Ireland.

Hope that helps üòäüëç
