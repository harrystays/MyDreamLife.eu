How to Work Easily In Switzerland as a EU citizen!


For some people, it's a dream to live and work in Switzerland. Although the life is extremely expensive, the country is also cool, "relax", beautiful and a with lot of nature.

Like Belgium, Switzerland has also three official languages. German, French and Italian. So for anyone who speaks one of those languages, can easily go to the Swiss region where that language is spoken.

Below, is the plan to work very easily in Switzerland if you are an EU citizen (except for Croatian, Romanian and Bulgarian citizens).

What most people don't say is that EU citizens can work legally in Switzerland for a maximum of 90 days per year calendar without any work permits (you will just need to bring your EU ID or EU passport) and register to your local cantonal migration offices within the 14 days).

Although it shouldn't be that complicated.., after that delay, you will have to apply for a residence permit and/or your employer will have to apply for a work permit.

The easiest will still be to find a job/internship online, apply, get the interview (nowadays, modern companies do it also online through Skype), then once you get hired, the company will take care of your work permit and you can move to Switzerland.

Big Swiss companies hire often people outside of Switzerland and will "help" you for opening a bank account and get your national tax number, etc.


Hope that helps!
