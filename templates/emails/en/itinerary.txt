Hi there!

First off, congratulation for the big step you just made! Over 80% of the population want to change their life or getting a better life but their will never do it! Life is too short and goes way faster than you think.

I see you are from [NATIONALITY_COUNTRY], living in [RESIDENCY_COUNTRY] and you want to move to [DESTINATION_AREA].
Your saving is [SAVING_AMOUNT] so for that reason I excluded London and Dublin (although they do have a lot of opportunities for designers), but the rent is from €13,000 for non-sharing (appartement).

Since you are a [NATIONALITY], you might be [NATIONALITY] native (or having a basic level at least...).

Because you prefer [LIFESTYLE], the place I found for you is definitely <strong>{THE DESTINATION PLACE}</strong>. Most of the companies there also speak English (if your German is not that good) and they do have a lot of job positions for you.


I already found a job for you with Visa sponsorship https://smava.softgarden.io/job/1232176?l=en (most of the companies do first a Skype Interview).
Although you can already move there straight away. Rent are quite cheap too!

The cheapest flight I found for you for the soonest in on the October first https://skywork.worldticket.net/en/booking/#FlightSearchPagePlace:true&BRN&TXL&2017-10-01&&0&CHF&&1=1,2=0,3=0& Just €140 (which give you €2860 before getting your job. Which is really good!)
