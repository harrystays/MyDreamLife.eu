Hi there!

First off, congratulation for the big step you just made! Over 80% of the population want to change their life or getting a better life but their will never do it! Life is too short and goes way faster than you think.

I see you are from [NATIONALITY_COUNTRY], living in [RESIDENCY_COUNTRY] and you want to move to [DESTINATION_AREA].
Your saving is not that much... so for that reason I excluded London and Dublin (although they do have a lot of opportunities for designers), but the rent is from €13,000 for non-sharing (appartement).

Since you are a Swiss, you might be German native (or having a basic level of Swiss at least).

Because you prefer big cities and capitals, the place I found for you is definitely Berlin. Most of the companies there also speak English (if your German is not that good) and they do have a lot of job positions for you.

You might need a work permit (not necessary since you are a Swiss citizen).
Switzerland. Under the EU-Switzerland agreement on the free movement of persons, Swiss nationals are free to live and work in the EU. Most EU citizens do not need a permit to work in Switzerland. Restrictions only apply to nationals of Croatia – who need a work permit.

I already found a job for you with Visa Sponrshonship https://smava.softgarden.io/job/1232176?l=en (most of the companies do first a Skype Interview).
Although you can already move there straight away. Rent are quite cheap too!

The cheapest flight I found for you for the soonest in on the October first https://skywork.worldticket.net/en/booking/#FlightSearchPagePlace:true&BRN&TXL&2017-10-01&&0&CHF&&1=1,2=0,3=0& Just €140 (which give you €2860 before getting your job. Which is really good!)

Those websites will help you finding the best apartment/house in Berlin
